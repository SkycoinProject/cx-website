# Latest release: CX v0.7beta

**CX chains**

The focus of this release is the **integration of CX into the Skycoin Fiber
blockchains, called CX chains**. Fiber is the way to create specialized
blockchains with CX code adapted to it, using Skycoin blockchain
technology. It is important to note that it is not the Skycoin blockchain
itself that is affected by CX chain, but a new blockchain using the same
technology. 

A CX chain is a blockchain that contains a CX program and everything that is necessary to run it in a series of updates. A CX chain works by separating a CX program into two parts: its program code and the so called transaction code. The program state is stored on the blockchain, and it is updated every time a transaction is run. In this case, "update" means that the new state is stored in a new block in the blockchain.
